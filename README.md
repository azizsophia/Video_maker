# Ketabi Studio 🎬

A **code-driven video engine** for Islamic content — your own replacement for
InVideo, built so every visual is programmable, reusable, and free to render.

This repo's **first milestone** is the signature feature: **Quran recitation
videos with word-by-word highlighting synced to a real reciter's audio.** Real
Arabic text lights up in perfect time with the recitation, with translation and
a fully code-generated animated backdrop. No stock clips, no generic AI — every
frame is drawn by code.

> Phone-first: you can render videos straight from the **GitHub mobile app**
> (no laptop needed) — see [Render from your phone](#render-from-your-phone).

## What's inside

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/QuranVideo/` | The Remotion composition: background, ayah view, word-by-word highlighting, themes |
| `src/data/sample-al-ikhlas.json` | A bundled sample (Surah Al-Ikhlas) so the engine runs out of the box |
| `scripts/fetch-ayahs.ts` | Pulls any surah/ayah range + real reciter audio + word timings from the free Quran.com API |
| `.github/workflows/render-quran.yml` | One-tap rendering you can trigger from your phone |
| `docs/SETUP.md` | API keys, network allowlist, Drive + ElevenLabs setup |

Built with [Remotion](https://remotion.dev) (React → MP4). Data from the free
[Quran.com API v4](https://api-docs.quran.com/).

## Render from your phone

1. Open the **GitHub app** → this repo → **Actions** tab.
2. Choose **"Render Quran Video"** → **Run workflow**.
3. Fill in: surah, (optional) ayah range, reciter, translation, theme, orientation.
4. When the run finishes, open it and download the MP4 from **Artifacts**.

Reciter ids: `2` AbdulBaset (Murattal) · `1` AbdulBaset (Mujawwad) · `3` Sudais · `6` Husary.
Translation ids: `20` Saheeh International · `131` The Clear Quran.

> Luhaidan & Dossary aren't on the free word-timing API yet — see
> `docs/SETUP.md` for how we can add them via forced alignment.

(Optional auto-upload to Google Drive is wired in `docs/SETUP.md`.)

## Run it on a computer

```bash
npm install

# Preview live in the browser (Remotion Studio)
npm run dev

# Pull a real passage + reciter audio, then render (Ayat al-Kursi by Abdul Basit)
npm run fetch -- --surah=2 --from=255 --to=255 --recitation=2 --theme=midnight
npx remotion render QuranRecitation out/ayat-al-kursi.mp4 --props=src/data/surah-2.json
```

Vertical (`QuranRecitation`, 1080×1920) is for Shorts/TikTok/Reels.
`QuranRecitationWide` (1920×1080) is for standard YouTube.

> **Heads up on network:** rendering downloads a headless Chrome from
> `remotion.media`, and `fetch` calls `api.quran.com` / `verses.quran.com`.
> In Claude Code web sessions these hosts must be added to the egress
> allowlist — see `docs/SETUP.md`. Normal machines and GitHub Actions have
> open internet, so it just works there.

## Roadmap

- [x] **M1 — Quran recitation template** (word-by-word synced, real reciters)
- [ ] **M2 — Story / prophets template**: script → ElevenLabs British narrator +
      Pexels stock visuals + captions (the InVideo replacement)
- [ ] **M3 — Phone web app**: Next.js on Vercel + Supabase; paste a script,
      pick a template, tap render, get the MP4 in your Drive
- [ ] **M4 — Auto-publish** helpers for YouTube / TikTok

See `docs/SETUP.md` to get the live pipeline running.
